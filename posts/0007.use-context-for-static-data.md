# Use context for static data

It's really useful to have a mindset shift and think about context not just as a "global state tool". Recently, I've used context to prevent prop drillings in a next.js application, here's how it works:

## The provider

Wrap your page in a custom provider component, here's how you define such provider:

```tsx
// static-data.provider.tsx

import { ReactNode, createContext } from "react";

type Props<T> = {
  data: T;
  children: ReactNode;
};

export const DataContext = createContext<any>(null);

const StaticDataProvider = <T,>({ data, children }: Props<T>) => {
  return <DataContext.Provider value={data}>{children}</DataContext.Provider>;
};

export { StaticDataProvider };
```

This creates a context and wraps the children passed to it with a context provider, making the context available throughout all the children. We use typescript generics to make sure this hook could be used for different pages and not just one.

Then you'll use it in your page like this:

```tsx
const MyPage: NextPage<Props> = (props) => {
  return (
    <StaticDataProvider<MyPageStaticData> data={props}>
      {/* your page content */}
    </StaticDataProvider>
  );
};
```

That weird inner angle bracket (`<MyPageStaticData>`) is how you can provide generic types when calling a component in jsx. Now let's define the hook that utilizes the above context to provide data for whatever component that wishes to use the data (deep down in the component tree):

```tsx
// useStaticData.ts

import { useContext } from "react";
import { DataContext } from "./static-data.provider";

const useStaticData = <T,>(): T => {
  const context = useContext<T>(DataContext);

  if (context === undefined) {
    throw new Error("useStaticData must be used within a StaticDataProvider");
  }

  if (context === null) {
    throw new Error("data must be available at all times");
  }

  return context;
};

export { useStaticData };
```

This makes sure you only use the hook inside the provider, also makes sure your data exists from the very beginning of the application life-cycle. And then, here's how you can use it:

```tsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { someData } = useStaticData<TripPageStaticData>();

  return <div>{someData}</div>;
};
```

This way you can use these hook & provider inside different pages and you can tell typescript what the types are so it won't bother you. You just have to make sure that you specify the right types since using generics is the equivalent of casting, so if you mess up your types, then you'll be sorry in production.
