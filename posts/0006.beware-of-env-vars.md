# Beware of env vars

Written on 2023-12-14

The other day, I was trying to find why the build system we had in a Create React App wasn't working when we used a 3rd party library and it caused an error when we tried to read environment variables, you know, like when you do `process.env.REACT_APP_SOMEVAR`. And I just read this line in the docs:

> Environment variables are embedded into the build, meaning anyone can view them by inspecting your app's files.

And this is true for all sorts of frontend applications or websites, since you are shipping the code to client's browser the easiest thing for these frameworks to do is to embed the env var as if they were using search & replace. Then I suddenly realized how we've been treating the `process.env` as if it was working on the server. This also means that if there are URLs to other services you connect to, this'll cause those URLs to be exposed and potentially crawled by google. Every time you use `process.env` and that code is bundled for client usage, make sure you would've been OK with it being hard-coded, since that's what's eventually happening anyway.
