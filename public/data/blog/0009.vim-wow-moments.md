These are things in vim that have wowed me, or have been game changers.

## Powerful search & replace

In the most simple form, it's almost like `sed`. Say you have `hi hello` on a line, then you could execute `:s/hi/bye` and it'll change to `bye hello`. That's all good and well, but here is the wow moment: Say you have this function call:

```
funcCall(arg1, arg2);
```

Now you realize you want to swap the two arguments. Sure it's easy to do it if it's in one place only, but suppose you have it in many places like this:

```
funcCall(arg1, arg2);
something();
funcCall(arg1, arg2);
something();
funcCall(arg1, arg2);
```

Then you can line select them all (Shift + v), then execute this:

```
:'<,'>s/(\(.*\), \(.*\))/(\2, \1)
```

Meaning, if you put literal paranthesis `\(` and `\)` around the `.*` (which matches any number of any character), then you can use `\1` and `\2` to access them later. This way you can swap things around.
