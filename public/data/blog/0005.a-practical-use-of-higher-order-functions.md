Recently I have had a nice practical use of higher order functions that made a lot of sense. It transformed the code to a much cleaner and DRYer version. I thought I share this with the internet! Everything you see below could also be found in the [sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/a-practical-use-of-higher-order-function-dtjied) that accompanies this post.

## The feature we want to build

A filter component that gets different types of filters and it has to be able to toggle each filter type into its own state. For simplicity, we will implement the filters as an array of strings. Open the sandbox referenced above to use the component in action.

## The state

As we have types of filters but the nature of those filters are the same (array of strings), we will use `useReducer` as that could handle the states much more efficiently and prevents us from repeating ourselves (making multiple similar states for each filter type). Let's first see the types of our state and its actions:

```ts
export type TState = {
  albums: string[];
  intensity: string[];
  duration: string[];
};

export type TAction = {
  type: keyof TState;
  payload: string[];
};
```

As you can see, we have a state object that contains three arrays of string as its properties. Our actions take a type respective to the properties of our state object and a payload. Super simple. Here is the reducer function:

```ts
import { TState, TAction } from "./type";

export function filterReducer(state: TState, action: TAction): TState {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "albums":
      return { ...state, albums: action.payload };
    case "intensity":
      return { ...state, intensity: action.payload };
    case "duration":
      return { ...state, duration: action.payload };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

The reducer simply sets the properties of our state object if the type matches that field. We should also create the initial state that we'll set for these filters, here is just that:

```ts
import { TState } from "./type";

export const initialState: TState = {
  albums: [],
  duration: [],
  intensity: [],
};
```

This means we could do stuff like this (this is just for those of you who are not familiar with reducers):

```ts
const albums = state.albums;

const setAlbums = (albums: string[]) => {
  dispatch({ type: "albums", payload: albums });
};
```

Now here are all filters that we have, imagine this is coming from backend and we don't really control it:

```ts
export const allFilters = {
  albums: [
    "72 seasons",
    "death magnetic",
    "load",
    "master of puppets",
    "hardwired... to self-destruct",
    "reload",
    "st. anger",
    "the black album",
  ],
  intensity: ["mellow", "soft", "medium", "hard", "diamond"],
  duration: ["short x<3 mins", "medium 3<x<8 mins", "long x>8 mins"],
};
```

## The components

We will have two, filters & filter, the plural one renders the singular. Here it is:

```ts
import React, { useReducer } from "react";
import { Filter } from "./filter";
import { allFilters, TAllFilters } from "../data/allFilters";
import { filterReducer } from "../state/filter-reducer";
import { initialState } from "../state/init";
import { generateToggler } from "../lib/generate-toggler";

function Filters() {
  const filterKeys = Object.keys(allFilters) as (keyof TAllFilters)[];
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(filterReducer, initialState); // *

  return (
    <div className="filters">
      <div>filters</div>
      <hr className="divider" />
      {filterKeys.map((name, index) => (
        <div key={index}>
          <Filter
            name={name}
            filters={allFilters[name]}
            activeFilters={state[name]}
            toggle={generateToggler(state, dispatch, name)} // **
          />
          <hr className="divider" />
        </div>
      ))}
      <pre>Applied filters: {JSON.stringify(state, undefined, 4)}</pre>
    </div>
  );
}

export { Filters };
```

Most of this is just boilerplate, the noteworthy lines are marked:

- \*: We give our reducer function and its initial state to React's `useReducer` so it'll generate the `state` and `dispatch` for us.
- \*\*: We'll come back to this after we explain our `generateToggler`, but for now, we just pass the result of that function call as a function named `toggle` so our filter component can use it to toggle filters.

Here is the filter component as well:

```ts
import React from "react";

type Props = {
  name: string;
  filters: string[];
  activeFilters: string[];
  toggle: (filterToToggle: string) => void;
};

function Filter({ name, filters, activeFilters, toggle }: Props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <div className="filter-title">{name} filter</div>
      {filters.map((filter, index) => (
        <button
          key={index}
          onClick={() => toggle(filter)}
          className={activeFilters.includes(filter) ? "active" : ""}
        >
          {filter}
        </button>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

export { Filter };
```

It renders buttons per filter item which call the `toggle` function we passed to it above. Now FINALLY, we can explain the thing we came here for:

## The higher order function

Here is a function that takes in the state (applied filters), a dispatch function, and the type of filter we are going to toggle the filter on (albums | intensity | duration). This function only returns another function. We'll see why shortly. Let's first explain the inner function:

- Takes a `filterToToggle` which is the value of the button that user clicked on
- Tries to find the given item in the state of already set items, those are given down from its parent `generateToggler`
- If found, it removes that item from the filter array, if not found, adds it to the end of the array

```ts
import React from "react";
import { TAction, TState } from "../state/type";

export type Result = (filterToToggle: string) => void;

export function generateToggler(
  state: TState,
  dipatch: React.Dispatch<TAction>,
  field: keyof TState
): Result {
  return function (filterToToggle: string) {
    const alreadyExists =
      state[field].findIndex(e => e === filterToToggle) > -1;
    if (alreadyExists) {
      const withoutCurrentFilter = state[field].filter(
        e => e !== filterToToggle
      );
      dipatch({ type: field, payload: withoutCurrentFilter });
    } else {
      const withCurrentFilter = [...state[field], filterToToggle]; // ***
      dipatch({ type: field, payload: withCurrentFilter });
    }
  };
}
```

Now pay attention again to the \*\* line in the `filters` component. Up there, we pass down the `state`, `dispatch`, and `name` to this function factory. The `name` argument is the most significant here, the returned function will be able to access `name`'s value due to how lexical scope works in javascript. This means the same function that is returned from `generateToggler` will have three separate `field` values, one per each function that we get (which we'll use per `filter` component). In other words, we have closed-over the value of `field`, which makes this combination of inner function and the `field` value a "closure".

Let's go over what happens in more simple words: When we render each `<Filter />` component we create a new function with a new `field` argument. This parameter gets stored in that function's context. Because javascript has lexical scope, this value will be available in the inner function, simply because the inner function is inside the outer one (we wrote it inside, so the inner one sees the outer one's arguments). This way we can re-use the inner function's logic and modify which filter it operates on from the outer function.

Note that the above isn't without its own downsides, if you are concerned with performance, you might not want to handle the \*\*\* line this way, since we are spreading the state, it means javascript will copy the entire current state, which might not be the most performant way, though since here my usecase included small arrays, immutability made sense over performance.
